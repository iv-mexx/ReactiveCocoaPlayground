# ReactiveCocoaPlayground

In this project I'll demonstrate isolated examples of [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) based on / as illustrations for questions on Stack Overflow.

For some examples I'll write more detailled explanations [in my blog](https://innovaptor.com/blog/).

# Getting Started

The easiest way to get a taste of ReactiveCocoa.

2. Open ReactiveCocoaPlayground.xcworkspace
3. Build ReactiveCocoaPlayground target
4. You are good to go. Enjoy.

# Thanks

Thanks to [Nikita Leonov](https://github.com/nikita-leonov) for the original [ReactiveCocoaPlayground](https://github.com/nikita-leonov/ReactiveCocoaPlayground) project. I was not able use RAC in a Playground before.
